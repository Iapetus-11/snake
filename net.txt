Multiplayer Snake
- Modes:
    - net play and local
    - VS - players can block each other off with their bodies and compete for fruit
    - COOP - same as VS except they can't block each other off (transparent to each other)


- Over TCP
- peer to peer
- JSON packets

{
    "p": 123, # packet type id
    "i": 123, # packet id
    "d": {} # data
}

- packets for movement, end/start game, disconnect
- movement of enemy is also played out on local
- if we have problems with de-syncing, we can instead of sending a movement
    packet, we can send the entire snake coord seq

- Another option would to be have dedicated servers, this would increase the 
    lag for LAN servers, but might reduce the lag for over-www play because
    each client would only have to connect to the server.
- dedicated servers would also reduce hacking but who tf would hack snake bruh
